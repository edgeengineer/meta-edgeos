Welcome to your secure account!

This is your first login. You are required to:
1. Change your password (you'll be prompted for this now)
2. Set up SSH key authentication

To set up SSH key authentication:

1. On your laptop, generate an SSH key pair if you haven't already:
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   (Press Enter to save in the default location, and optionally set a passphrase)

2. Display your public key on your laptop:
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

3. Copy the output (it starts with 'ssh-ed25519' and ends with your email)
   and paste it when prompted.

After this setup, you can log in without a password using:
ssh edge@$(hostname)
